		<p>Before I go on and finish up my lesson, I wanted to thank the people 
                          who run the Juelle Web Design Course for the opportunity 
                          to take this course. Taking this course reminded me 
                          to pay more attention to the little things that make 
                          the difference between a so-so web page and a polished 
                          page. Over the past six weeks or so, I've created twenty 
                          complete web designs (and a couple more that haven't 
                          been used yet!) with all the little goodies that make 
                          a page complete from buttons and bars to background 
                          and layout. I've also used some techniques that I've 
                          never bothered with before like the java applet on this 
                          page. If you haven't already, take a look through the 
                          rest of the pages of <a href="index.html">my portfolio</a>.</p>
                        <p>If you want to take the course yourself. (And to comply 
                          with one of the parameters for my final as well. Two 
                          birds with one stone, don't you know?) Here is a banner 
                          on which you can click to go to the home page for the 
                          Juelle Web Design Course. The link will open in a new 
                          page, so you can continue looking at my pages.</p>

                        <p>It has taken me a long, long time to finish this lesson, 
                          the last one in the course. For some reason, I have 
                          had a terrible time coming up with anything I like for 
                          more than a few minutes or the half an hour or so it 
                          takes to create the basic graphics and get the first 
                          page laid out.</p>
                        <p>Finally on Thursday, April 13th, we had a rain shower 
                          and I saw the beatiful double rainbow in the picture 
                          above. Of course I grabbed my camera, and it got me 
                          to thinking about all of the pictures I've taken in 
                          and around Port Jervis over the past three years since 
                          I moved back here from Redmond. I decided to make my 
                          little mini website about the beauty of nature using 
                          my own photos.</p>
                        <p>I chose a fairly neutral background for these pages 
                          so the beauties of nature will take center stage. If 
                          you follow through the pages, you'll get to see several 
                          particularly beautiful scenes that were taken in and 
                          near the city of Port Jervis, New York where I live. 
                          I hope you enjoy the tour. Oh, and just in case you 
                          are interested, the tile for the background was made 
                          from the picture on this page.</p>
                        <p>You can navigate through the next four pages using 
                          the buttons below, or you can click on one of the seasons 
                          on the ring to go directly to the page for that season.</p>
