            <p>This lesson is all about creating banners, logos, and buttons that 
              can be used for advertising your site on other websites. This lesson 
              asks us to create three objects: a logo, a banner, and a button.</p>
            <p>Here is my banner. I used the colors from my page. I can use this 
              banner with banner exchanges, or just for people who want to tell 
              others about my website. I'm not sure whether banner exchanges still 
              require gif format, but I've saved this as a jpg because it is smaller.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="lesson8/banner.jpg" width="468" height="60" /></p>
            <p>Here is a logo. Not sure where I'd use this because it's a little 
              on the big side, but I do like it. For those of you who have seen 
              the tutorial on which it is based, I used a different flower because 
              that shape isn't included with PSP X. In fact, most of the shapes 
              and presettings are no longer included. It seems as though every 
              version of PSP gives you less to work with for free.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="lesson8/logo.jpg" width="225" height="225" /></p>
            <p>Finally, this is a button. It's really plain, but I think it might 
              be effective. The size I've chosen is described by PSP as a &quot;mini-button&quot; 
              so there really isn't much room to create anything here.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="lesson8/is_button.jpg" width="88" height="31" /></p>
            <p>Of course, the designs on this page are just a sampling of what 
              can be created with a little imagination and any one of these examples 
              could have been animated, although that doesn't attract attention 
              in the same way it did when animated images were new and exciting.</p>
