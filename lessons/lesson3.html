                                    <p align="left">The photograph used in the 
                                      title for Lesson 3 is from a clip art collection 
                                      I purchased a long time ago, called "Multimedia 
                                      Graphics Pack" from Media Graphics. The 
                                      font used for the word "Welcome" is called 
                                      86Design and I'm not really sure where I 
                                      got it but it seemed appropriate.</p>
                                    <p align="left">The object of this lesson 
                                      was to make a coordinated set with background 
                                      tiles, a title, a separator bar, and three 
                                      buttons. This is the result.</p>
                                    <p align="left">I picked five colors from 
                                      that picture to create the graphics for 
                                      this page. Here is my palette:</p>
                                    <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/palette.jpg" width="156" height="32" alt="Page palette" /></p>
                                    <p align="left">I made five tiles for the 
                                      background design using Corel PaintShop 
                                      Pro X and the colors in the palette. The 
                                      first three tiles were made by starting 
                                      with a selection I copied from the title 
                                      graphic. Once I had that small picture, 
                                      I took the following steps:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>For the first, I started by resizing 
                                        the picture to 128x128 pixels.</li>
                                      <li>Adjust, Brightness &amp; Contract, Brightness/Contrast... 
                                        with Brightness: 20 and Contrast: 10</li>
                                      <li>Select Effects, Texture Effects, Blinds... 
                                        with Width: 10, Opacity: 50, Color: #4B167, 
                                        and Horizontal and Light from Left/Top, 
                                        both checked.</li>
                                      <li>Effects, Reflection, Kaleidoscope, with 
                                        Horizontal Offset: 0, Vertical Offset: 
                                        0, Rotation angle: 0, Scale factor: 0, 
                                        Number of Petals: 8, Number of Orbits: 
                                        0, Radial Suction: 0, and Edge Mode: Repeat.</li>
                                      <li>Finally I selected Effects, Image Effects, 
                                        Seamless Tileing... with Tiling Method: 
                                        Corner, Direction: Bi-directional, both 
                                        Horizontal and Vertical Offset: 0, Tranistion 
                                        %: 50, and Corner Style: Curved. Here 
                                        is the result:</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg1.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="Pattern 1" /></p>
                                    <p align="left">The second tile started with 
                                      a copy of the first. Then I used Effects, 
                                      Reflectio Effects, Patern... with Horizontal 
                                      Offset, Vertical Offset, and Rotation angle 
                                      all 0, Scale Factor: 50, Number of Columns: 
                                      3, and Number of Rows 3. Here is the second 
                                      tile:</p>
                                    <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg2.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Pattern 2" /></p>
                                    <p align="left">Finally, the third tile started 
                                      with the resized piece I cut from the title. 
                                      There were only three steps on this one:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>I used Eye Candy 4000, Fur... with the 
                                        preset &quot;Flowing&quot;</li>
                                      <li>Simple, Pizza Slice Mirror</li>
                                      <li>Effects, Image Effects, Seamless Tiling... 
                                        with the same settings as above, except 
                                        that the Tiling Method was: Mirror. Here 
                                        is tile number 3:</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg3.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Pattern 3" /></p>
                                    <p align="left">Tile 4 was created using the 
                                      two shades of green from the palette in 
                                      much the same way I created the pattern 
                                      tile for <a href="lesson2.html" title="See Lesson 2">Lesson 
                                      2</a>. I used the airbrush with the &quot;sponge 
                                      round medium&quot; brush and the two shades 
                                      of green for foreground and background colors. 
                                      I alternatively left and right-clicked to 
                                      lay down blotches of the two colors until 
                                      I was satisfied and then used Effects, Image 
                                      Effects, Seamless Tilling... with the same 
                                      settings as for the first tile. This is 
                                      the tile I used for the narrow dividing 
                                      bands:</p>
                                    <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg4.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Green pattern" /></p>
                                    <p align="left">The final tile was a 4x4 pixel 
                                      tile of the background color so I could 
                                      be sure that the title and other graphics 
                                      would have the same background color as 
                                      the text. The bar was made with a font called 
                                      &quot;Separators&quot; and the buttons were 
                                      made by cutting the central flower from 
                                      the title image out and reducing it to a 
                                      small enough size so that it didn't overwhelm 
                                      the button. The button itself is simply 
                                      a rectangle of the medium purple that has 
                                      had a bevel applied to it and the text is 
                                      plain old Arial to make it easy to read.</p>
