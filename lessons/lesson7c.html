            <p>The picture above is from a collection of stock photos that I own. 
              The picture and the quote are a little bit of early Mother's Day 
              sentiment, but the true purpose of course, is to show you a third 
              way to make effective use of fonts.</p>
            <p>This time I've used graphics to make sure that you see the fancy 
              font I wanted to show you in the title and the little quote about 
              Motherhood. The advantage here is that you can be sure that the 
              person viewing the page will see the page pretty much as you want 
              it seen. The disadvantage here is, of course, that the page will 
              take longer to load than it would have if the page didn't have such 
              large graphics. In the case of this page, the hit isn't too terrible 
              for people who are visiting the page with a high-speed connection. 
              However, if you are using dial-up to view this page, you might notice 
              a significant delay before the page loads completely.</p>
            <p>This is the third part of a lesson on using fonts in a web page 
              to the best advantage. The first two pages use two methods for making 
              the page looks as good as it possibly can.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first page, <a href="lesson7.html">Lesson 7</a>, uses fancy 
                fonts only for the title and buttons.</li>
              <li>The second, <a href="lesson7b.html">Lesson 7b</a>, uses a fancy 
                font throughout but includes a link to the location where the 
                font may be downloaded for free.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This page uses fonts to display a block of text but the text was 
              created as an image using PaintShop Pro X and then the image was 
              inserted in the page. I've tried to make the pages as different 
              as I possibly can to make the exercise more interesting to those 
              who are not taking the web course.</p>
