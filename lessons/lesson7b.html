            <p><b>This page has been set up so it uses the font SF Gothican. Chances 
              are that you are not seeing the text on this page using that font 
              becuase you probably don't have it on your system. Furthermore, 
              chances are that the text on this screen appears to be really large 
              and perhaps really ugly. If you would like to see the page as I 
              created it, you can download it from <a href="http://www.1001freefonts.com/fonts/sfonts5.htm" title="Get the font used on this page." target="_blank">Download 
              Fonts - 1001 Free Fonts</a>. (By the way, the link will open in 
              a separate page so you can download the font, install it or open 
              the font file, and then close the new window to return to this page.</b></p>
            <p><b>I wouldn't normally use such a strange font and simply expect 
              you to download it, but this is part of an example of the different 
              ways you can use fonts in a web page. The reason I wouldn't normally 
              expect you to download a font just to view my page is that if you 
              don't, the page probalby looks really horrible. Now, if you really 
              need to show something in a particular font, you can create the 
              font using your graphics appication and insert it into the page 
              as a graphic. I've done that on the third page for this lesson, 
              <a href="lesson7c.html">Lesson 7c</a>. If you've already viewed 
              that page, or are done anyway, you can return to <a href="lesson7.html">Lesson 
              7</a>.</b></p>
