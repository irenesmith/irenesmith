            <h1 align="center">Lesson 4<br />
              Bordered Background Set</h1>
            <p>This time, the object of the lesson is to create a set that uses 
              a bordered background. The one I've created here is based on a piece 
              of a graphic from the same graphics collection, "Multimedia Graphics 
              Pack" from Media Graphics, that I used for the set in lesson three. 
              The bucket of popcorn was actually part of a much larger graphic 
              but I cut away the rest of the picture and just used the popcorn. 
              My intention was to give this page the feeling of a circus or carnival.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="lesson4/bar.jpg" width="386" height="68" alt="separator" /></p>
            <p>The lesson asked us to make a web set with a bordered background, 
              a title graphic, a separator bar, and three buttons as before. To 
              be truthful, I haven't exactly followed the parameters of the lesson. 
              For one thing, I made my border much wider than what was called 
              for in the lesson. These are the changes I made:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The background graphic on this page is 1600 pixels wide instead 
                of 1050 because I use a much higher screen resolution. Actually, 
                I've been creating side borders that are 1600 pixels wide since 
                1996 when learned how to make them. I'm not sure how much longer 
                this is going to be adequate, but with LCD monitors (with a native 
                screen resolution of 1280x1024) becoming more common, I'd say 
                1600 pixels is a safer bet.</li>
              <li>My clear.gif, the file that was used to space out the page and 
                keep the text from flowing over the border, is 1 pixel by 1 pixel. 
                You only really need one pixel of height for your spacer and this 
                makes the graphic as small as it possibly can be.</li>
              <li>In order to keep my text from flowing as wide as the table cell, 
                I nested another table within the righthand table cell that is 
                90% of the width of the cell it is in and centered in the cell. 
                That way my text seems to be centered without using the CENTER 
                tag. That leaves the individual paragraphs left-justified but 
                makes the text appear in the horizontal center of the cell.</li>
              <li>I made an extra button so you could send me an message and tell 
                me what you think of this set.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By the way, in case you're curious, I have created a <a href="lesson4b.html" title="Bordered background without clear.gif" target="_blank">copy 
              of this page</a> without the use of clear.gif, so you can see how 
              horrible it looks without the spacer graphic.</p>
