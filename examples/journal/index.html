    <p class='title'>My Self-Care Journal</p>

    <h1>How I Spend my Time</h1>
    <date><em>September 29, 2019</em></date>

    <p>I'm jealous of people who can write a journal by hand, who
    can draw in it, and allow it to be less than beautifully formatted. I couldn't
    stand to make the pie chart for my day by hand. So... I opened Excel and made
    this chart:</p>

    <p><img width="701" height="541" src="img/image002.png"></p>

    <p>This is my <i>ideal</i> day, even if it isn't my perfect day.
    Right now, only the work part is true. I work for 8 hours. Well... sometimes
    more than eight but they only pay me for eight hours.</p>

    <h2>Sleep</h2>

    <p>I'm lucky if I get six hours a day. I always tell myself I'm
    going to go to bed early and sleep more. And, now that we have a Sleep Number
    Bed, there's just one more piece of technology to shame me. &quot;<i>Oh, your
    sleep score went down because you only slept four hours.</i>&quot;</p>

    <p>If they ever came up with a way that people can go without
    sleep 24/7, I'd be first in line to try it out. I feel as though sleep is a
    huge timewaster. There are so many more important, interesting things I could
    be doing.</p>

    <h2>Self-Care</h2>

    <p>For me, self-care is mostly wishful thinking. I have reached
    a point where I must force myself to take a shower and wash my hair. I wear the
    same clothes day after day, and don't even bother with my nails anymore. I
    stopped coloring my hair, don't wear makeup, and spend my days in t-shirts and
    whatever pants I can wear.</p>

    <h2>Adulting</h2>

    <p>My husband does the adulting in our family. When I was
    commuting to the city, he took over the home chores. He pays the bills and takes
    care of our son, not that he needs <span class=GramE>much</span> care anymore. I
    used to commute to New York City, 2.5 hours each way. When I stopped commuting,
    he said he didn't want to change it.</p>

    <h2>TV/Movies/Family</h2>

    <p>I probably spend most time with my son.</p>

    <p>We both love movies and video games. He wants to be a
    director and he's about to graduate from community college. We love to watch
    movies together. My husband isn't so much into movies anymore. He spends his
    time fixing up our house and works much harder than I can. He's twelve years
    older than I am but he works much harder and gets much more done. It's somewhat
    embarrassing.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>

    <p>I'm morbidly obese but I spend less time eating than I say
    in the chart. I often skip breakfast and lunch. When I do eat, I'm usually
    working at the same time. The last time I ate without working at the same time
    is the last time we went out to eat.</p>

    <h2>Journaling</h2>

    <p>This is new.</p>

    <p>I allocated 15 minutes a day to write in my journal but I'm
    resisting it. I didn't even notice that I was resisting it until I realized
    that I had spent a week &quot;thinking about&quot; starting to write. I was
    going to try to handwrite the journal, but I can't bring myself to do that. Too
    messy. So today, the <i>29th of September</i> is my first day writing at all.</p>

    <p>Finally, I decided that doing it is more important than
    practicing my handwriting. I'm in a bad state right now. And I'm not sure why.
    I think the only way I'm getting out is by going through and that's why I
    signed up for this course in the first place.</p>

    <p>I have gradually increased the time to the point where I
    have given over half an hour a day to writing in my journal.</p>

    <p>Not sure what I'm going to do on November 1st when I no
    longer have a day job (Until I find a new one, of course!) I'm thinking that
    I'd like to give at least half of my day to writing but I'm a little bit scared
    too.</p>

    <p>The exercises in this workshop have freed up my fingers. I'm
    writing regularly again for the first time in over 18 months. I've done a bit
    of writing since then but other than what I write for work, it has felt forced
    and lacked any sense of joy or adventure. Thanks to this course, I'm writing
    again and playing with the words and ideas.</p>

    <h1>Prompt 1: Cultivate Joy</h1>

    <date><em>September 30, 2019</em></date>

    <p>Before I even start to write this, the first thing that pops
    into my head is, &quot;This is bullshit.&quot; They say that when you find
    yourself resisting something it's the thing you need to do. Even now, I feel a
    bit silly about one or two of the things on my list. I've tried to be honest
    though, so...</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        I love <span class=SpellE>laying</span> in bed, reading a book with soft music playing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Talking at night in bed with my husband - there's something so intimate about talking
        in our darkened bedroom. It seems romantic, sexy, and so intimate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any time spent with my family. I love to travel; I love to just sit around talking.
      </li>
      <li>
        I get joy from watching movies with my family. I enjoy watching movies when I'm alone
        too but it's best when my husband, son, and my mother join me. Somehow, even a bad
        movie is better when it's with company.
      </li>
      <li>
        I like eating meals with my family too. This is something we have not been doing
        lately. My mother had a stroke almost a year ago and she has moved in with us. I
        must admit that the three of us have been eating upstairs in our &quot;offices&quot;
        because the kitchen has become crowded. Lately we instituted a weekly dinner that we
        take the time to plan. My mother is happy because she is not alone, and we are happy
        because we no longer feel as though Mom pushed us out of our home.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love reading a good book. I used to read three or more books a week. Lately it
        takes me weeks to read a book. Then again, a year ago, I thought I was losing my
        sight altogether and couldn't read a book at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love creating web pages. I like playing with the styles and creating the images.
        I enjoy adding programming to make the page interactive.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also like creating desktop programs even though I don't do it as often as I used to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wandering around a library or bookstore, especially a bookstore.
      </li>
      <li>
        Good food gives me joy until I remember the damage it is doing to me. Being on a
        diet all the time does not give me joy, especially since dieting doesn't seem
        to work anymore. No matter how little I eat, I don't seem to lose weight.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also love going out and taking pictures. This is something I haven't done much
        lately.
      </li>
      <img width="629" height="472" src="img/image004.jpg">
      <li>
        Although I am happy that I don't have to commute to New York City for work anymore,
        I miss the city. I especially love traveling to New York City during holiday
        season. The sights and sounds always made me feel happy, even when I was exhausted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting new books. I have pillows for that one...
      </li>
      <img width="624" height="407" src="img/image006.jpg">
      <li>
        Riding a bicycle early in the morning when most people are still in bed
      </li>
      <li>
        Traveling by train. I used to commute to the city five days a week. I used to love
        it but I just can't stand the stress anymore. I love New York City and wandering
        around Manhattan but the five to six hours the commute adds to my day are just too much.
      </li>
      <li>
        Silly, geeky things like a lighted keyboard!
      </li>
      <img width="624" height="180" src="img/image008.jpg">
    </ol>

    <h1>Prompt 2: Work through Regret</h1>

    <date><em>October 7, 2019</em></date>

    <h2>Things that I regret...</h2>

    <p>
      I wish I had finished my degree sooner. I played around too much and didn't take
      the opportunity to learn when I could do it for free. (Yet I don't regret that I
      finally did go back and finish.)
    </p>

    <p>
      I regret being a coward. I let my mother and father convince me that I couldn't
      take care of myself. I lived with them until I finally married my husband. I believed
      them when they told me that I wasn't good enough to be a writer.
    </p>

    <h2>Desires?</h2>

    <p>I want to travel more, but I don't want to travel only for
    work, I want to travel with my husband. When we were married, he promised to
    take me to Paris. I want to work towards that trip.</p>

    <p>Even though I have a BS/IT, what I want is an MFA. I want to
    work out how to go back to school.</p>

    <h1>Prompt 3: Redefine Success</h1>

    <date><em>October 12, 2019</em></date>

    <h2>My understanding of success:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Being a good housekeeper</li>
      <li>Having a husband</li>
      <li>Raising children</li>
      <li>Graduate from college</li>
      <li>Owning my own home</li>
      <li>Being perfect, physically, and mentally</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I never came close to achieving the things I thought I <em>should</em> want.</p>

    <h2 style='margin-left:50%'>What success has become:</h2>
    <ol style="margin-left:50%">
      <li>I do have a husband and a son.</li>
      <li>I love (and like) my stepchildren and grandchildren.</li>
      <li>I finally graduated from college, but more for
        the sake of the piece of paper than anything else.</li>
      <li>I make good money and support my family while my
        husband takes care of the house. It works!</li>
      <li>I'm working on feeling better and looking better
        but I'm not expecting to get down to 110 lbs.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>I'm not perfect in any way but I've come to accept that I am
    on the way to become the best version of me.</p>

    <h1>Prompt 4: Letter to myself at 30</h1>

    <date><em>October 13, 2019</em></date>

    <p style="text-align:left; text-indent:0;">Dear Irene,</p>

    <p>Life didn't turn out quite like we planned. Don't get me
    wrong, it isn't bad, but it isn't what I expected at all.</p>

    <p>
      I know you think we're going to be a famous writer. It hasn't happened yet.
      We published a book, but few people have noticed it. Even so, I keep working at it.
    </p>

    <img width="624" height="226" src="img/image010.jpg">

    <p>
      Some of the things you dreamed about have come true. You still enjoy playing
      video games. Not only that, you published three of your own. Your curiosity about
      programming paid off in many more ways than you expected. You have been making
      money with your computer skills since 1991, so just wait a couple of years!
    </p>

    <p>
      And it seems you can't get away from it. Every time we decided to do something
      else, we always ended up back with programming, writing about programming, or
      something similar. We have been able to work at cool places too, such as Microsoft,
      Google, and Mozilla.</p>

    <p>
      And travel? We've traveled on business to New York (from Washington State),
      Florida, Hawaii, San Francisco, and last year we went to London.
    </p>

    <p>
      You married Warren, the love of your life and it turned out well. He is the
      man you thought he was, and he has loved and supported everything you have
      done or wanted to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img style="float: left; margin-right: 1rem; margin-bottom:1rem;" width="240" height="240" src="img/image012.jpg">Together
      you have a son who seems to be an extremely talented young man. When I watch
      him at work, I can believe he will beat the odds and fulfill his dream of
      becoming a movie director.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a little scary when he arrived 3 months early. You can see how tiny
      he was! And in that picture, he had already grown a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm running out of things to say. I think that for the most part things
      have turned out extremely well. Sometimes I miss smoking, but I don't regret
      quitting. There have been false starts along the way but taking the time to
      write this letter has reminded me that life isn't over yet and we still have
      things to do.
    </p>

    <h1>Prompt 5: Write from a Quote</h1>
    <date><em>October 15, 2019</em></date>

    <img width="624" height="312" src="img/image014.jpg"></p>

    <p>
      I posted this image to my Twitter account a while back. I found the image
      on either Pixabay or Unsplash and added the quote myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis Carroll has been one of my favorite story tellers since I was a child.
      Grandma gave me a set of record albums with Cyril Ritchard reading <cite>Alice in
        Wonderland</cite>, not an abridged children's version but the entire book!
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, Lewis Carroll's words remind me to be adventurous. Even though it says
      &quot;explanations,&quot; in my mind, I think of hesitation instead. In other
      words, there are times when you must take the chance and <em>do something</em>.
      This attitude allowed me to fly across the country from New York to Washington
      to interview for a job at Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a time when I believed in Magic (with a capital 'M'!) that could make
      amazing things happen if you only open yourself up to the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stopping to think about the idea of &quot;<em>adventures first</em>,&quot; I feel
      energized and ready to find my next challenge. When my contract ends on November
      1st, I'm going to begin writing a novel that I have tried to write before but
      failed. This time, I'm ready for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This quote also reminds me of a time seven years ago, my employer fired me from
      a job that I was beginning to hate anyway. There was a change a couple of levels
      above my boss and <span class=GramE>most of</span> my colleagues and I were fired
      for one reason or another over the next six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      My manager told me on my last day. I called my husband and told him what happened
      and then had to make the 2.5-hour trip home. When I arrived, he met me at the train
      with flowers and a card. The card said &quot;Life with you has been a wonderful
      adventure. I can't wait to see what happens next.&quot;
    </p>
