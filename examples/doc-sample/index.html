	                Creating a website involves more than sitting down and starting
	                to type stuff. Take a look at the steps I follow when creating a new
	                website, whether for myself or someone else.

	        	<header><h2>Define the Project</h2></header>
	        	<p>Think about the following when roughing out the design. You need to
	        	define:</p>
	        	<ul>
	        		<li>
	                    <strong>The audience</strong> - Who are the visitors to this
	                    website? You need to understand who will be viewing the site and
	                    what they are expecting the site to do for them.Is the
	                    average visitor an experienced computer user or a beginner?
	                    Perhaps the site will provide services for children?
	                </li>
	                <li>
	                    <strong>The purpose</strong> the site will serve for its customers.
	                    Do you need to make a sale or are visitors to the site ready to buy
	                    something you are selling. If the site will be providing information
	                    only, what information are they looking for? Keep it on topic! Are
	                    they looking for information or some item they want to buy from you. 
	                </li>
	                <li>
	                    Do you expect to sign up customers for a newsletter or just to simplify
	                    their future visits to the website? What information will you need from
	                    visitors and how are you going to gain their trust enough to make them
	                    want to give you that information?
	                </li>
	        	</ul>
	        	<p>
	                Once you know what visitors need, and what you need to provide to satisfy their needs, you
	                can go on the next step in website design...

	        	<header><h2>Plan the Content</h2></header>
	        	<p>
	                Once you have defined the goal and identified your audience, you can
	                plan out the site's content:
	            </p>

	        	<ul>
	        		<li>Define the site structure
	        			<p>It is easier to visualize the structure of a website if you
	        			create a diagram using an application like Visio.</p>
	        		</li>
	        		<li>Define the navigation</li>
	        		<li>Select a color scheme</li>
	        		<li>Gather the images, videos, and icons</li>
	        		<li>Write the text for the site
	        			<p>Now is the time to write the text your visitors
	        			will see on the site.</p>
	        		</li>
	        	</ul>
	        </section>
	        <section class="main-section" id="Sketch_the_Design">
	        	<header><h2>Sketch the Design</h2></header>
	        	<p>
	        		Now that you have defined the content, you can sketch out the design.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		Lay out the content so it is organized according to the site structure, i.e.
	        		information about the site on the About page, information about products on
	        		the product page, etc.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		You can draw the page designs using PhotoShop or you can just draw on paper.
	        		Draw the page header and footer, the layout of the text, and 
	        </section>

	                    Make sure that the site loads properly in all browsers. If it doesn't, make sure
	                    that you define a reasonable fall-back so that the content is readable.
	                </li>
	                <li>Make sure that the site loads quickly</li>
