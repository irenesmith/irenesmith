			We are all made up of multiple
			personalities, depending on the situation and the people around us,
			don't you agree? There is the you that hangs out with your friends,
			and the one that goes to work every day. You might behave
			diferently around your family than you do when you're out with your
			friends. I am no different.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is the part of me that is a
			<strong>writer</strong>. I write about programming and web design.
			But in my heart of hearts, I am a story teller. I like writing almost
			as much as I like talking... and I <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> to
			talk. Just try to stop me. I dare you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then there is the <strong>programmer</strong>. I
			became a programmer because I wanted to understand how computers
			work. Okay, the truth is that I became a programmer because I couldn't
			afford a disk drive. Then I discovered that it was fun! I still think
			programming is fun and love learning new ways languages, algorithms, and
			design patterns.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Web design</strong> has elements of
			programming and of writing. There is also creative design. I've been
			making websites from front-end to back since 1996. It started out
			as a hobby and now I'm getting the opportunity to teach others how
			design, develop, and code websites as part of my contract at Mozilla.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Photography?</strong> Yes. My
			father taught me to use a camera when I was a little girl. Now, with
			digital photography, I can take as many photographs as I want
			without worrrying about buying film or paying to have them developed.
		</p>
