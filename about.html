				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			I am a wife, a mother, and my official title at work is Firefox Developer Content Manager.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the past I have sold advertising, worked as a Secretary and an Office
			Manager. I have also been a technical writer, a programmer, a teacher,
			and even a Travel Agent. I had a very hard time deciding what I wanted to
			be when I grow up. And, since I haven't really grown up yet, I have plenty
			of time, right?
		</p>
		<p>
			We all have multiple personalities.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is the you that hangs out with your friends, and the one that goes
			to work every day. You might behave diferently around your family than
			you do when you're out with your friends. I am no different.
		</p>
		<h2>Writer</h2>
		<div>
			<img id="first-pub" class="desaturate" src="img/first_pub.jpg" alt="Front cover of magazine with my first publication" />
			<p>
				There is the part of me that is a <strong>writer</strong>. By day, I
				write about programming and web design. But in my heart of hearts, I am a
				story teller. I like writing almost as much as I like talking... and I
				<strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> to talk.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just try to stop me... I dare you.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Programmer</h2>
		<p>
			Then there is the <strong>programmer</strong>. I became a programmer
			because I wanted to understand how computers work. Okay, the truth is
			that I became a programmer because I couldn't afford a disk drive. Then
			I discovered that it was fun! I still think programming is fun and love
			learning new ways languages, algorithms, and design patterns.
		</p>

		<h2>Web Designer</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Web design</strong> has elements of
			programming and of writing. There is also creative design. I've been
			making websites from front-end to back since 1996. It started out
			as a hobby and now I'm getting the opportunity to teach others how
			design, develop, and code websites as part of my contract at Mozilla.
		</p>
		<h2>Photographer</h2>
		<div>
			<img id="irene-camera" class="desaturate" src="img/irene_003.jpg" alt="Picture of Irene as a child" />
			<p>
				<strong>Photography?</strong> Yes. My father taught me to use a camera
				when I was a little girl. Now, with digital photography, I can take as
				many photographs as I want without worrrying about buying film or paying
				to have them developed.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>The whole package...</h2>
