			<p>Did you graduate in 1977, 1978, or 1979?</p>
			<p>Seems like it's been forever, doesn't it? Facebook is cool, but it's more fun to get together 
			in person. Why don't you join us for a good old fashioned get together? Plans are underway
			now. So, if you're interested, click that big ol' button below and sign up. We promise we
			won't share your information with anybody else, but we will keep you up to date on the plans.</p>
			<p>And, if you have the band width, volunteer to help.</p>
