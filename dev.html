								<td><strong>IS Contacts</strong></td>
								<td>A <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> application that was created as a learning exercise. The program uses
								<abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> data binding and <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> styles, templates, and triggers.</td>
							</tr>						
							<tr>
								<td><strong>Movies</strong></td>
								<td>This <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> application is based on the File Example that I created while taking my
								last course, .NET II. I am refactoring the application to use <abbr title="Model-View-ViewModel">MVVM</abbr> and, ultimately, store the data in a
								database.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><strong>Tipster</strong></td>
								<td><p>This is an extremely simple application. It includes <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> styles, but has no
								data storage features and uses event handling rather than <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> commands. The program calculates the tip, total
								meal bill, and cost per person given the meal total, the tip percentage and the number of diners. The
								code for this example is available on my GitHub account under 
								<a href="https://github.com/irenesmith/IS_CSharp_Examples" target="_blank">IS_CSharp_Examples</a>
								in the Tipster folder.</p>

							<tr>
								<td><strong>Data Validation Example</strong></td>
								<td><p>Created for POS/409, .NET II, C# - This program performs data entry validation
								using regular expressions. The sample data was obtained from a data mocking service.
								Here is a screenshot:</p>
								<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/validation_example.png" alt="A screenshot of the Data Validation Example." /></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><strong>File I/O Example</strong></td>
								<td>
								<p>Created for POS/409, .NET II, C#. This program was written to show simple file
								handling. It loads and parses a text file into a list of movies. The data for each
								movie includes the title, the format (DVD or Blu-ray), the genre, and the year it was
								released. The program is stupid. In other words, the file name is hard-wired and although
								you can edit existing movies, there is no facility to add new movies or delete existing
								ones. I originally intended to finish it but ended up creating a <abbr title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</abbr> 
								version instead. The code for this example is available on my GitHub account under 
								<a href="https://github.com/irenesmith/IS_CSharp_Examples" target="_blank">IS_CSharp_Examples</a>
								in the FileExample folder.</p>
								<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/FileExample.png" alt="A screenshot of the File Example." />

							<tr>
								<td><strong>Customer Relationship Management</strong></td>
								<td><p>Created for POS/408, .NET I, Visual Basic. This was a team project. I did most
								of the interface design for this project. Source code for this was not uploaded to
								GitHub because it is not all mine. Below is a screenshot.</p>

							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><strong>PieChart Applet</strong></td>
								<td><p>Created for PRG/421, Java Programming II. Although it seemed sort of a waste of time to
								create a Java applet at this point when Java is disabled in most people's browsers, but this is
								it. The only truly interesting thing about it is that the code for the applet draws the pie chart
								on the fly, calculating and drawing the chart when it runs.</p>

		                    about half of my time on development projects. Here are the highlights.

		                                <li>A website on the company Intranet that allowed users to browse the glossary. The website
		                                    was created using C# and ASP .NET.</li>
		                                <li>A sub-site that is only available to selected people who have editing permissions
		                                    so that they can add new terms and definitions and edit existing terms. This was
		                                    also an ASP .NET application written in C#.</li>
		                                <li>An add-in for Microsoft Word that was used company wide to insert industry terms and
		                                    definitions into Microsoft Word requirements, design documents, and end-user
		                                    documents. The add-in was written in C# but the template that was added in Version 2.0
		                                    also used some VBA macros as well.</li>
		                            </ul>
		                            The application had two releases. Version 1.0 included only terms and definitions. In Version 2.0,
		                            I added multi-language support and auditing as well as a set of boilerplate document parts and a
		                            global template to give all users of Microsoft Word in the company the same set of base styles and
		                            document parts.

		                            application that was used to extract documentation comments from a project and save the results in
		                            XML format. The program was able to work with C#, Java, and Ruby on Rails projects. The second part of
		                            the project is a Microsoft Word add-in that loads the XML file and inserts the data into a Design
		                            Specification with tables for UI pages/web forms, classes, and database objects.

		                            that we used to make sure the developers are adding documentation comments to their code. It can check
		                            a project, including the stored procedures. It counts the objects and then generates an HTML report
		                            that lists the total number of objects that require comments compared to the actual number of comments
		                            and the percentage of coverage.

		                        issues. The advantage of a workbook over a document is that the data could be sorted easily
		                        by column and/or filtered to show a specific type of issues. The Excel workbook</td>
