    	    	  <p>This picture of me with my son was taken in 1999 when we had just moved to Redmond, WA so I could take a job working as a contractor at Microsoft. Despite what you may think, that sign actually existed. It appeared on 156th Ave. NE (Microsoft Way) and stayed there for a couple of days before someone took it down. In the background, you can see the building across the street where the Visual Studio people had their office back then.</p>
							<p>I picked five colors from that picture to create the graphics for this page. Here is my palette:</p>
							<img class="palette" src="lesson2/palette.jpg" width="156" height="32" alt="palette" />
              <p>
								I made three tiles for the background design using Corel
								PaintShop Pro X and the colors in the palette. The marble
								texture was created using a soft, fairly small airbrush with
								which I placed random blotches of all the colors until I
								acheived a pleasant-looking patter. I then used the Seamless
								Tiling command under Effects, Image Effects to make sure that 
								the image would tile seamlessly. Here is the tile:
							</p>
							<p class="centered"><img src="lesson2/bkg2.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="Marble Pattern" /></p>
							<p>
								I created a custom gradient using the five colors in my palette
								and then made a seamless tile out of it by using the Seamless
								Tiling command again. Here is that tile:
							</p>
							<p class="centered"><img src="lesson2/gradient.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Gradient" /></p>
							<p>
								The final tile was a small square in the background color. I
								created it originally because sometimes the color you defined
								for a web page didn't exactly match the color in a graphic. It
								doesn't seem to be a problem anymore, so I'm not bothering to
								use it on these updated pages.
