        Bordered Background Set</h1>

    <p>
      This time, the object of the lesson is to create a set that uses a
      bordered background. The one I've created here is based on a piece of a
      graphic from the same graphics collection, "Multimedia Graphics Pack"
      from Media Graphics, that I used for the set in lesson three. The bucket
      of popcorn was actually part of a much larger graphic but I cut away the
      rest of the picture and just used the popcorn. My intention was to give
      this page the feeling of a circus or carnival.

    <p>
      The lesson asked us to make a web set with a bordered background, a title
      graphic, a separator bar, and three buttons as before. In order to update
      the set to follow modern web design practices, these are the changes I
      made:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The background graphic for this set was originally 1600 pixels wide.
        The original lesson called for a width of 1050 pixels but even back
        in 2006, I use a much higher screen resolution. These days, even 1600
        pixels isn't wide enough. Thankfully, CSS gives us a better way to make
        a border background that doesn't repeat.
      </li>
      <li>
        A bordered background layout used to be created using a table and a
        transparent 1x1 pixel image. The transparent image prevented the first
        (empty) column of the table from collapsing. I can't remember if Firefox
        collapsed empty table columns but I know that good old IE did. The
        "transparent pixel trick" took that tiny image and set its width to the
        width you wanted to move the text to the right and avoid the border.
        Since it is transparent, it would, it wasn't visible in your layout.
        Modern CSS provides us with an easier way to move the text off the
        border. Add a new rule like this:<br>
        <br>
        <code><em>background-repeat: repeat-y;</em></code><br>
        <br>
        Using <em>repeat-y</em> for your background means that it only repeats
        vertically instead of vertically and horizontally.
