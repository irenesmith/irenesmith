			Created by Irene Smith in 2006 as part of a web design course. This page
			was created for Lesson one. The colors used here were selected from the
			background tile and are as follows:
		</p>
		<img class="palette" src="lesson1/palette.jpg" alt="page palette">
		<table class="color-table">
			<tr>
				<td>LINK:</td><td>#56cfe2</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>TEXT:</td><td>#915ed9</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>VISITED:</td><td>#39c78d</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>BACKGROUND</td><td>#f2cfd3</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<img class="bar" src="lesson1/bar.jpg" alt="">
		<p>
			I'm pretty sure that this tile was created according to a tutorial
			because I'd never have called it tubescope otherwise. I would
			probably have named it something to do with the color or the fact
			that this was apparently made with the Easter Egg tube that I got
			with PSP (PaintShop Pro).
