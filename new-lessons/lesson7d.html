      <h2>Method 4</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Google fonts have been around for a while but it is yet another way to add
      interesting fonts to your website. You don't want to include many fonts
      using this method, because it can slow down page loading, but one or two
      fonts won't have much impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The font used for heading text on this page is called "Mountains of
      Christmas" and it is a Google font. You can get the appropriate link for
      your website by going to <a href="fonts.google.com">fonts.google.com</a>
      and searching for it by name.

      When this page was created, in May of 2019, it was nowhere near Christmas
      but the heat prompted me to think of colder weather. (Yes, already!)
