    <p>
      The title says it all. This lesson is about using fonts. The right font 
      can add to the impact of your web page. Unfortunately, it's difficult 
      to guess in advance which fonts your visitors will have. The majority 
      will, of course, have the standard Windows fonts which includes Verdana, 
      Arial, Times New Roman, and Comic Sans MS. You can't really even count 
      on that, howeer, because there are going to be visitors who use other 
      operating systems, such as Linux or Mac OSx. In addition, fancier fonts 
      like the one used in the title above (called Bones, by the way) aren't 
      going to be available to all of your readers. This is just one more way 
      in which web page design is imprecise, more of a guess than a gaurantee.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways you can use fonts, and some are better than others. 
      These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use only those fonts that are likely to be installed on most visitors 
        systems. That means you will need to confine yourself to about half 
        a dozen fonts including Arial, Comic Sans, Verdana, Times New Roman, 
        and Courier New. If you define fonts explicitly, you can provide a list 
        of fonts so that if the visitor doesn't have one font, another can be 
        substituted.</li>
      <li>Use the fonts you want to use and make the font available on the web 
        page or provide a link to the website where the font can be downloaded. 
        Again, you can provide a list of font names and so that if the visitor 
        doesn't have one font, another font will be substituted.</li>
      <li>Create the text as a graphic and insert the graphic into your page. 
        This has the advantage that you don't have to ask the reader to install 
        anything but it makes the page load more slowly because the graphic 
        is certain to be larger than the same amount of text.</li>
      <li>
        This last one has been available for a while now, you can use Google
        fonts or fonts from another online font repository. You add the name
        of the font to the head, linking to it just as you would a CSS
        stylesheet and then refer to the font in your CSS.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img class="bar" src="lesson7/bar1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This page (except for the buttons, bar, and title) uses the first method. 
      Chances are that you are seeing the text on this page as Verdana, because 
      that's how I defined it. There is a small chance that you are seeing something 
      else, but even so, the text should look pretty good overall.</p>
    <p>I have also created two (now three!) other pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="lesson7b.html">Lesson 7b</a> - a page that uses a fancy font 
        but a link to the font so vistors can download and install the font to 
        see the page as I wanted them to see it. Pro: you can use any font that
        grants you the license to use it on websites. The con? A lot of people
        won't download fonts just to satisfy your artistic desires.
      </li>
      <li><a href="lesson7c.html">Lesson 7c</a> - a page for which I created 
        a block of text in a fancy font using PaintShop Pro X. I made the image 
        as small as possible, but it still takes longer than the to load than
        this page, lesson 7b, or lesson 7d.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="lesson7d.html">Lesson 7d</a> - a page that links to a font on
        Google Fonts to use a font that would otherwise not be available on
        most visitors' computers. This has been possible for about eight years
        but it wasn't availble back when I was creating these pages.
