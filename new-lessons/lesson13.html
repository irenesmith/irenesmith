		<p>
			Lesson 13 is all about mouseovers. What is a mouseover? A mouseover is when
			the graphics on a page change when the <i>mouse</i> passes <i>over</i> them.
			It does this using JavaScript code that handles the <code>mouseover</code>
			and <code>mouseout</code> events. For more information about responding to
			mouse events in JavaScript, take a look at the list of
			<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#Mouse_events'>Mouse
				Events</a> on <a href='developer.mozilla.org'>MDN Web docs</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to see an example, try moving the mouse over the title graphic
			and watch what happens. Using mouseovers does more than add a little animation
			to your page too. Mouseovers can be used to provide feedback or more information
			to visitors.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll notice that the buttons on this page also change when you point at
			them with the mouse. In all cases, the mouseover effect on this page
			was created by using two images, one for the regular state of the graphic
			and the other for when the mouse pointer is over it. JavaScript code takes
			care of swapping the images when the mouse pointer enters or leaves
			the screen space over the graphic.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was something about this background color that made me think
			of the chalkboards they used to have in some classrooms. They weren't
			black, they were a sort of blue-green, so I found a font that looks
			like writing with chalk and voila!
