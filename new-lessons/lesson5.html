        <a href="lesson4.html" title="Lesson 4 - Bordered Backgrounds">Lesson
        4</a> covered left-borders, now in Lesson 5 we're to create a double
        border. I created three background graphics for this page. The left
        border, the right border, and a tiny tile for the background to make
        sure it matches the small piece of background on the inner edge of the
        border graphics.

        The original page was set up in a table with three columns, one for
        each part of the border. It used transparent gifs and for some reason,
        it refused to cover the entire height of the page. To update, I used
        the new <strong>CSS grid</strong> feature.

        You can see what I'm talking about with the following image I captured
        using Firefox DevTools. As of this writing in May of 2019, Firefox is
        the only browser with a grid inspector that lets you look at the layout
        of your CSS grids. It's really useful. (It is only fair to tell you that
        I am the Firefox Developer Content Manager for MDN Web Docs, but I used
        their development tools before I got the job.)

      <img id="grid-image" src="lesson5/lesson5_grid.png" alt="grid for this page">
      <p>
          As you can see from the purple outlines, I have three columns: left
          border, content, and right border. The nice thing about grid is that
          the center solumn will automatically become wider and narrower to fit
          its content.
      </p>

        The design in the border is yet another piece out of one of my 
        clip art collections. The thin gold border and the shadows were 
        aded by me using Corel PaintShop Pro X and the Flaming Pear filter 
        Super BladePro. I created the title, the buttons, and the bar by 
        taking pieces from the diamond part of the border which I cut out 
        and resized appropriately as I needed it.
