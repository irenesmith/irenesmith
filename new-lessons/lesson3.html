              <p>
                The photograph used in the title for Lesson 3 is from a clip
                art collection I purchased a long time ago, called "Multimedia
                Graphics Pack" from Media Graphics. The font used for the word
                "Welcome" is called 86Design and I'm not really sure where I
                got it but it seemed appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The object of this lesson was to make a coordinated set with
                background tiles, a title, a separator bar, and three buttons.
                This is the result.
              </p>
              <p>
                I picked five colors from that picture to create the graphics
                forthis page. Here is my palette:
              </p>
              <img class="palette" src="lesson3/palette.jpg" alt="Page palette">
              <p>
                I made five tiles for the background design using Corel
                PaintShop Pro X and the colors in the palette. The first three
                tiles were made by starting with a selection I copied from the
                title graphic. Once I had that small picture, I took the
                following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>I resized the picture to 128x128 pixels.</li>
                <li>Adjust &gt; Brightness &amp; Contrast &gt;
                  Brightness/Contrast... with Brightness: 20 and Contrast: 10</li>
                <li>Select Effects &gt; Texture Effects &gt; Blinds... with
                  Width: 10, Opacity: 50, Color: #4B167, and Horizontal and
                  Light from Left/Top, both checked.</li>
                <li>Effects, Reflection, Kaleidoscope, with 
                  Horizontal Offset: 0, Vertical Offset: 
                  0, Rotation angle: 0, Scale factor: 0, 
                  Number of Petals: 8, Number of Orbits: 
                  0, Radial Suction: 0, and Edge Mode: Repeat.</li>
                <li>Finally I selected Effects, Image Effects, 
                  Seamless Tileing... with Tiling Method: 
                  Corner, Direction: Bi-directional, both 
                  Horizontal and Vertical Offset: 0, Tranistion 
                  %: 50, and Corner Style: Curved. Here 
                  is the result:</li>
              </ol>
              <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg1.jpg" width="125" height="125" alt="Pattern 1" /></p>
              <p align="left">The second tile started with 
                a copy of the first. Then I used Effects, 
                Reflectio Effects, Patern... with Horizontal 
                Offset, Vertical Offset, and Rotation angle 
                all 0, Scale Factor: 50, Number of Columns: 
                3, and Number of Rows 3. Here is the second 
                tile:</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg2.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Pattern 2" /></p>
              <p align="left">Finally, the third tile started 
                with the resized piece I cut from the title. 
                There were only three steps on this one:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>I used Eye Candy 4000, Fur... with the 
                  preset &quot;Flowing&quot;</li>
                <li>Simple, Pizza Slice Mirror</li>
                <li>Effects, Image Effects, Seamless Tiling... 
                  with the same settings as above, except 
                  that the Tiling Method was: Mirror. Here 
                  is tile number 3:</li>
              </ol>
              <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg3.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Pattern 3" /></p>
              <p align="left">Tile 4 was created using the 
                two shades of green from the palette in 
                much the same way I created the pattern 
                tile for <a href="lesson2.html" title="See Lesson 2">Lesson 
                2</a>. I used the airbrush with the &quot;sponge 
                round medium&quot; brush and the two shades 
                of green for foreground and background colors. 
                I alternatively left and right-clicked to 
                lay down blotches of the two colors until 
                I was satisfied and then used Effects, Image 
                Effects, Seamless Tilling... with the same 
                settings as for the first tile. This is 
                the tile I used for the narrow dividing 
                bands:</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="lesson3/bkg4.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Green pattern" /></p>
              <p align="left">The final tile was a 4x4 pixel 
                tile of the background color so I could 
                be sure that the title and other graphics 
                would have the same background color as 
                the text.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bar was made with a font called  &quot;Separators&quot; and
                the buttons were made by cutting the central flower from the
                title image out and reducing it to a small enough size so that
                it didn't overwhelm the button. The button itself is simply a
                rectangle of the medium purple that has had a bevel applied to
                it and the text is plain old Arial to make it easy to read.
              </p>
