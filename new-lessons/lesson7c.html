        <p>The picture above is from a collection of stock photos that I own.
          The picture and the quote are a little bit of early Mother's Day
          sentiment, but the true purpose of course, is to show you a third
          way to make effective use of fonts.</p>
        <p>This time I've used graphics to make sure that you see the fancy
          font I wanted to show you in the title and the little quote about
          Motherhood. The advantage here is that you can be sure that the
          person viewing the page will see the page pretty much as you want
          it seen. The disadvantage here is, of course, that the page will
          take longer to load than it would have if the page didn't have such
          large graphics. In the case of this page, the hit isn't too terrible
          for people who are visiting the page with a high-speed connection.
          However, if you are using dial-up to view this page, you might notice
          a significant delay before the page loads completely.</p>
        <p>This is the third part of a lesson on using fonts in a web page
          to the best advantage. The first two pages use two methods for making
          the page looks as good as it possibly can.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The first page, <a href="lesson7.html">Lesson 7</a>, uses fancy
            fonts only for the title and buttons.</li>
          <li>The second, <a href="lesson7b.html">Lesson 7b</a>, uses a fancy
            font throughout but includes a link to the location where the
            font may be downloaded for free.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This page uses fonts to display a block of text but the text was
          created as an image using PaintShop Pro X and then the image was
          inserted in the page. I've tried to make the pages as different
          as I possibly can to make the exercise more interesting to those
          who are not taking the web course.</p>
