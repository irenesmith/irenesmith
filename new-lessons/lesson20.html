          <h1>The Grand Finale</h1>
          <p>
            Before I go on and finish up my lesson, I wanted to thank the people
            who run the Juelle Web Design Course for the opportunity
            to take this course. Taking this course reminded me
            to pay more attention to the little things that make
            the difference between a so-so web page and a polished
            page. Over the past six weeks or so, I've created twenty
            complete web designs (and a couple more that haven't
            been used yet!) with all the little goodies that make
            a page complete from buttons and bars to background
            and layout. I've also used some techniques that I've
            never bothered with before like the java applet on this
            page. If you haven't already, take a look through the
            rest of the pages of <a href="index.html">my portfolio</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to take the course yourself. (And to comply
            with one of the parameters for my final as well. Two
            birds with one stone, don't you know?) Here is a banner
            on which you can click to go to the home page for the
            Juelle Web Design Course. The link will open in a new
            page, so you can continue looking at my pages.

            It has taken me a long, long time to finish this lesson,
            the last one in the course. For some reason, I have
            had a terrible time coming up with anything I like for
            more than a few minutes or the half an hour or so it
            takes to create the basic graphics and get the first
            page laid out.
          </p>

            Finally on Thursday, April 13th, we had a rain shower
            and I saw the beatiful double rainbow in the picture
            above. Of course I grabbed my camera, and it got me
            to thinking about all of the pictures I've taken in
            and around Port Jervis over the past three years since
            I moved back here from Redmond. I decided to make my
            little mini website about the beauty of nature using
            my own photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose a fairly neutral background for these pages
            so the beauties of nature will take center stage. If
            you follow through the pages, you'll get to see several
            particularly beautiful scenes that were taken in and
            near the city of Port Jervis, New York where I live.
            I hope you enjoy the tour. Oh, and just in case you
            are interested, the tile for the background was made
            from the picture on this page.
          </p>

            You can navigate through the next four pages using
            the buttons below, or you can click on one of the seasons
            on the ring to go directly to the page for that season.
