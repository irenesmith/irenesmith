        <p>This page has been set up so it uses the font SF Gothican.
          Chances are that you are not seeing the text on this page using that
          font becuase you probably don't have it on your system. Furthermore,
          chances are that the text on this screen appears to be really large
          and perhaps really ugly. If you would like to see the page as I
          created it, you can download it from
          <a href="https://www.dafont.com/sf-gothican.font" title="Get the font used on this page." target="_blank">from
            dafont.com</a>.
          (By the way, the link will open in a separate page so you can
          download the font, install it or open the font file, and then close
          the new window to return to this page.
        </p>

          I wouldn't normally use such a strange font and simply expect
          you to download it, but this is part of an example of the different
          ways you can use fonts in a web page. The reason I wouldn't normally
          expect you to download a font just to view my page is that if you
          don't, the page probalby looks really horrible. Now, if you really
          need to show something in a particular font, you can create an
          image using the font in your graphics appication and insert it into
          the page as a graphic. I've done that on the third page for this
          lesson, <a href="lesson7c.html">Lesson 7c</a>. If you've already
          viewed that page, or are done anyway, you can return to
          <a href="lesson7.html">Lesson 7</a>.
