        <p>Lesson 10 is all about using Java Applets. And, basically, all I can
          say is that Java Applets are over and done. Some of the features of Java
          applets can be emulated using HTML canvas or animations, but Java is
          blocked in most modern web browsers. And don't hold your breath for
          Adobe Flash either. It is on the way out as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantage to applets was that you could use them to do things
          with your web page that would be difficult to do otherwise because
          Java used to work with most browsers and most operating systems. Of
          course, by using a Java applet had its downside as well. One is that
          loading the applet greatly increased the amount of time it took to
          load the page containing the applet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I can find any equivalent, I'll update the page. In the meantime?

          There's nothing to see here, move along!
