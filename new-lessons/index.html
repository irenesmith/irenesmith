                The set of web pages in this section were created as part of
                an online course in web design back in 2006. I have taken those
                pages and updated the markup and CSS to HTML5/CSS3 respectively.
                I have removed the graphics that identified the course (the
                website seems to have gone out of business anyway), so all of
                the graphics on these pages were created by me using Corel
                PaintShop Pro X. Photos are either royalty-free photos taken
                from clip art collections I own or taken by me or a family
                member.

                My husband took the photo on this page in 1999. We had just
                moved to Redmond, WA so I could take a job working as a
                contractor at Microsoft. That's me with my son who was just
                over three years old at the time.

                Despite what you may think, the sign actually existed. It
                appeared on 156th Ave. NE (Microsoft Way) and stayed there for
                a couple of days before someone took it down. Just outside of
                your view on the left is the building where the Visual Studio
                people had their offices back then.</p>
              <p>You can view the original pages I created for the course if you
                want to compare the old and new.
