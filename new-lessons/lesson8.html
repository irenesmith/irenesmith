        <p>This lesson is all about creating banners, logos, and buttons that
          can be used for advertising your site on other websites. This lesson
          asks us to create three objects: a logo, a banner, and a button.</p>
        <p>Here is my banner. I used the colors from my page. I can use this
          banner with banner exchanges, or just for people who want to tell
          others about my website. I'm not sure whether banner exchanges still
          require gif format, but I've saved this as a jpg because it is smaller.</p>
        <p class="centered"><img src="lesson8/banner.jpg" width="468" height="60" /></p>
        <p>Here is a logo. Not sure where I'd use this because it's a little
          on the big side, but I do like it. For those of you who have seen
          the tutorial on which it is based, I used a different flower because
          that shape isn't included with PSP X. In fact, most of the shapes
          and presettings are no longer included. It seems as though every
          version of PSP gives you less to work with for free.</p>
        <p class="centered"><img src="lesson8/logo.jpg" width="225" height="225" /></p>
        <p>Finally, this is a button. It's really plain, but I think it might
          be effective. The size I've chosen is described by PSP as a &quot;mini-button&quot;
          so there really isn't much room to create anything here.</p>
        <p class="centered"><img src="lesson8/is_button.jpg" width="88" height="31" /></p>
        <p>Of course, the designs on this page are just a sampling of what
          can be created with a little imagination and any one of these examples
          could have been animated, although that doesn't attract attention
          in the same way it did when animated images were new and exciting.</p>
