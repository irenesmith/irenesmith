      <h1>Modernizing a website</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a discussion of what you need to change if you are "lucky"
        enough to have to update an old website. Some of the things you
        <em>must</em> do because the existing features are deprecated or
        removed altogether. Other's are just best practices that probably
        didn't exist ten or fifteen years ago.
      </p>

    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Remove deprecated attributes and tags</h3>
    <p>
      Start by removing deprecated attributes and tags. Define fonts,
      width and height, margins, and borders using CSS instead of attributes
      or tags. This has the huge advantage that if you change your mind, you
      can change it anywhere with a single edit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that:
    </p>
    <code>
      &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a paragraph<br>
      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
    </code>
    <p>
        will become:
    </p>
    <code>
      &lt;p class="centered"&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a paragraph<br>
      &lt;/p&gt;<br>
    </code>
    <p>with this CSS:</p>
    <code>
      body {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: "Times New Roman", "serif";<br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    p.centered {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;text-align:center;<br>
    }<br>
    </code>
    <p>
      This looks like more code but, if you had six paragraphs and each of
      them had the same HTML, you're repeating that code over and over
      while the modernized page has the definition for fonts and alignment
      only once. And if, six months from now, you decide you would rather
      use Arial and have the paragraphs right-aligned, you would have to
      make the change in all six paragraphs. Now imagine having six to ten
      paragraphs on fifty different web pages. What are the chances that
      you will forget to change at least one?
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>img</code> tag now requires an <code>alt</code> attribute. The
      contents of the attribute should be a description of the image. However,
      if the image is purely decorative, leaving it empty <code>alt=""</code>
      descriptive software won't bother mentioning it. Sor, for example, it
      means nothing to a vision-impaired visitor to know that you have a
      separator bar on the page. That's why all of the example bar images have
      an <code>alt</code> tag set to the empty string.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Consider your fonts and color palette</h3>
    <p>
      Early web pages sometimes used some bizarre color combinations. Not only
      text on a solid colored background, but text on super-busy patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another difficulty with early web pages was the size of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this combination. How easy is it to read this text?
    </p>
    <div class="bizarre">
      How would you like to read a whole page of text this size and with this
      color combination? This type is 10 points high, a common font size back
      in the day.
    </div>
    <p>
      I admit that I deliberately used a pair of colors with less than optimal
      content. And the size is small, but I have actually seen websites just
      like this. Be glad that I didn't make it blink or something!
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Replace table layout</h3>
    <p>
      Unless you are actually displaying tables of data, replace tables with
      an alternative layout. Use divs and CSS grid or CSS flexbox layout
      instead. Tables slow down page load because the browser has to render
      the entire table. Also, tables quickly get out of hand and you end up
      with multiple nested tables. If nothing else, it makes your marked up
      source code more difficult to read.
    </p>
    <h3>Validate your markup!</h3>
    <p>
      The W3C provides tools to validate your HTML and CSS markup. The tools
      are free and easy to use. Even if you haven't uploaded your files to the
      server, you can still use the HTML and CSS validation tools. Here are the
      links:
