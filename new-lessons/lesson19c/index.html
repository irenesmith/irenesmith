      <p>
        Lesson 19, the next to the last, is all about frames. I have left an
        unedited copy of the two pages I originally made that use frames so you
        can see them. However, you probably shouldn't use frames.
      </p>
      <h2>Why shouldn't I use frames?</h2>
      <p>
        Besides the fact that frames are no longer a part of the HTMl 5
        specification, frames have other disadvantages as well:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you want to make your website accessible, using frames will get in
          the way. Frames are not conducive to an accessible site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Search engines won't properly scan your site and the page that is
          linked from the search engine listing may not be the one  you want
          your visitors to see. If the listing points directly to one of your
          content pages. The page may load without a menu or some other vital
          content missing.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML 5 does not support frames. You can use iFrames in HTML 5, but
            traditional frames and framesets are not allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Probably the biggest disadvantage of a framed site, of course, is the fact 
          that you can't bookmark individual pages, only the page that contains the frameset. 
          Sometimes, however, this disadvantage is an advantage because it forces visitors 
          to start in the same place on every visit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The story &quot;Twenty-one Grams&quot; was a prize 
        winner in the flash fiction contest at Another Realm last year. It's less than 
        1,000 words, so it won't take you long to read it.

        I also made a different example of frames, this one a little bit more complicated 
        than the first. Follow the link to <a href="../lesson19b.html" target="_top">Lesson 19b</a> 
        to see it.
