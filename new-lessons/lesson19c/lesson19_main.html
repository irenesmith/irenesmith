<p>Lesson 19, the next to the last, is all about frames. This page uses frames. 
  The menu on the left is in a separate frame from the content section here on 
  the right. Clearly the advantage is that the menu on the left will stay in view 
  at all times, even if the content of this frame is longer than the height of 
  the screen. You can scroll this side of the window up and down without disturbing 
  the menu at all.</p>
<p>Unless your monitor is really small and you have to view this page at 640x480 
  pixels, there won't be a scrollbar on the menu frame, but the content frame 
  will have a scrollbar when it needs one.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of a framed site, of course, is the fact 
  that you can't bookmark individual pages, only the page that contains the frameset. 
  Sometimes, however, this disadvantage is an advantage because it forces visitors 
  to start in the same place on every visit.</p>
<p>The homework for this lesson was to load more than one page into this frame, 
  to show how it works and that's what I've done. If you look at the menu, you'll 
  see that you can go back to Lesson 18, go to the index of my Portfolio, or go 
  ahead to Lesson 19. These links will load in the full screen, in other words, 
  without the frames. <strong>Lesson 19</strong> will take you back to this page, 
  and <strong>21 Grams</strong> will take you to a reprint of one of my stories 
  that uses this same layout. The story &quot;Twenty-one Grams&quot; was a prize 
  winner in the flash fiction contest at Another Realm last year. It's less than 
  1,000 words, so it won't take you long to read it.</p>
<p>Also, as always, you can click on the E-Mail link to send me a message with 
  comments or quesitons about this page.</p>
<p>I also made a different example of frames, this one a little bit more complicated 
  than the first. Follow the link to <a href="../lesson19b.html" target="_top">Lesson 19b</a> 
  to see it.</p>
