    <h1><small>(Yet another)</small> Border Background</h1>
    <p>
      This is so easy that it's almost embarrassing. The trouble is, if you do
      this enough, you will get bored with it and want other layouts with which
      to work.

      Although it doesn't look like it, but border image is only a little wider
      than the shadow. Take a look:
    </p>
    <img id="bkg-example" src="img/blue_border_01.png" alt="">
    <p>
      I've drawn a black border around the image so you can see its size better.
